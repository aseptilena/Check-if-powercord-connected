Why : 
I don't work at home , usually on campus. I plug my power cord in , then when I leave , I often forget to put the power cord back in my bag. I have to go back and get it after I realize I don't have it a few hours later , which is very irritating . Hopefully , this piece of code helps. 


Packages required : 
power (should be there with your default python installation , check either way)
os (should be there with your default python installation , check either way)
easygui 
time

How : 
pip install PackageName 

Process :
1. Open cmd . Select a directory of your choice . Install the packages .
2.Download the checkpower.pyw file and save it in the same folder . 
2. Double click on it . Done . 
3. If you want to close it , hit ctrl+alt+del , in background processes , look for "pythonw" and close it . 

Additional : 
If you want the program to run byh default everytime you boot up your laptop , click on the windows icon , hit "run" . In the window that opens , type "shell:common startup" if you want this feature to be available for all users , or type "shell:startup" if you want it to be available to the current user. In there , create a shortcut to the checkpower.pyw . 

Tested on : 
Windows 10 , running Python 2.7 .
